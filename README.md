# ActivityMonitor

This is the resurrection of the [original Personal Activity Monitor](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=activitymonitor). There is another resurrection variant in
[Github's rbicelli](https://github.com/rbicelli/ActivityMonitor) but he/she has changed it to Windows Form, while I still prefer to use WPF (for the future port to .NET 6).
