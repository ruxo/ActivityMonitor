# Activity Monitor

This is the resurrection of the [original Personal Activity Monitor](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=activitymonitor). There is another resurrection 
variant in [Github's rbicelli](https://github.com/rbicelli/ActivityMonitor) but he/she has changed it to Windows Form, while I still prefer to use
WPF (for the future port to .NET 6).

### Changes

0.1.6.1: Migrated projects to .NET 5. Remove unnecessary dependencies.
